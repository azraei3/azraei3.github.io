## Design Thinking
Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that emphasizes understanding user needs, defining challenges, generating creative ideas, building prototypes, testing, and implementing solutions. It's a methodical and human-centered process aimed at creating innovative and effective solutions by empathizing with users and iteratively refining ideas. This approach encourages collaboration, diverse perspectives, and optimism in finding solutions to complex problems.
