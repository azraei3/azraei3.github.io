## Assignment 1 Clarity Techworks
On November 14, 2023, Clarity Techworks SDN BHD conducted Industrial Talk 1, presenting diverse insights into their company and job opportunities in roles such as Android developer, WEB/API developer, UI/UX designer, and testing analyst. The session aimed to enlighten participants on the company's operations and potential career paths. Following this engaging discourse, attendees were assigned the task of crafting a poster summarizing the key takeaways from the industrial talk. The [poster](https://github.com/azraei3/azraei3.github.io/blob/main/Assignments/Clarity%20techwork.pdf) serves as a visual representation of the event, condensing the valuable information shared during the session for easy reference and dissemination.
